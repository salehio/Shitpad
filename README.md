# Shitpad
Quick and dirty PCB design to practice/PoC some keyboard stuff

- 4 regular switches
- 2 rotary encoders sharing a pin
- Elite-Pi MCU
- Broken out all pins to headers to help prototype other components
- 2 diodes in parallel to test out differences between TH and SMD
- 2 PCBs can be combined into a larger KB using i2c available through TRRS or USB-Micro
